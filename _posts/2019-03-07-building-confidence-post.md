# Introduction
---

This is one of the harder posts in this series for me to write, as I am publicly not that confident when it comes to speaking. It’s a battle I find I’m fighting each time I know I have to present.

There are a few techniques I use to help with this, and a number that have been advised to me over the last couple of years. For the rest of this blog, we will explore them.

# Talking through the ideas with someone you feel comfortable with.

---

This is something I do throughout all the stages of a talk. From coming up the idea, constructing it into a talk, to adjusting and evolving the ideas in the talk.

Talking through the concepts and points you feel you want to discuss with someone in the same industry is useful as:

- #### It shows which of the points you are strongest on. 
The areas you are particularly passionate or defensive of — the ones you can defend to the end of the earth — those are the bits of your talk you know inside and out. The other areas you may want to get more comfortable with or talk in less detail about.

- #### You can develop the ideas and expand on the points.
Having another person’s point of view can open your eyes to other angles to the subject matter and expand upon your own views.

Doing this helps me. I can show to myself I know my subject matter. I can reinforce my ideas and have them evolve through discussion in an environment which is safe. I can find out what areas I need to research more on. 

## Bullet-point your thoughts.

When I was first taught about writing code, I was told to write the logical steps in bullet points. I do the same with talks.

I write bullet points on the points I would like to make, or demos I would like to do on paper. I then read through and sort them into a coherent order.

Knowing I have a logical order to the talks helps my confidence as I know I can make it sound natural and have a flow of points. Flow is something that will be covered in a later blog, but for me, if I can make a talk feel less like a presentation of points and more like a conversation, it helps with the lack of confidence.

# Rehearse (in stages).

---

Knowing your content can help with confidence.

People approach rehearsing their talks in different ways. I find it best to first rehearse at home.

- #### Full talk, relaxed setting. 
First without timers and then introducing timed sections. This doesn’t have to be a full performance, I sit on the sofa with my clicker in hand, laptop on lap.

- #### Practising the sections that you are less comfortable with. 
A full rehearsal will show which sections you don’t know that well. You don’t need to rehearse the full talk each time.

- #### Rehearsing in a fake presentation setting. 
Closer to the actual talk, I like to hook my laptop up to the TV and practice the talk the way I would present it. It means I can use the space of the room, not rely on reading notes I have and get a feel for what it might feel like to present.

Some others have suggested:

- #### Talking in the bath. 
Personally, I like my baths to remain a relaxing, safe space, free of work. I do know someone who likes to practice their talks in the bath as then they can rehearse without glancing at their notes. Apparently, their bathroom has good acoustics too.

- #### Listening to recordings of yourself. 
Some like to record their talks and listening to it as part of their practice.

For me, there is such a thing as over-rehearsing. I trip up if I think I miss a point in the talk. I find once a week for about 3 weeks before the talk is peachy for me. You will find your own balance and rhythm.

# Present in a setting that feels less scary to you.

---

There are numerous ways you can test the waters for your talk and help with your confidence in presenting it.

- #### Blog the content. 
Write out your ideas and reaffirm your knowledge of the content of the talk. Added bonus — you can refer to your blog in your talk in case you miss anything or don’t have time to go into the details.

- #### Internal talk at work. 
Ask your work if you can present either the full talk or a shorter version on a Friday afternoon. Get feedback and criticism from people whose opinion you trust.

- #### (Local) meetup. 
Present your ideas at a meetup. There are loads of great meetups in the East Midlands, which is great for me as I get more nervous presenting in front of people I know than people I don’t know. Some others find it easier to present to familiar faces. You have the choice of both across the East Midlands. Support your local meetups by providing them with the great, up and coming speaker that is you, and get a confidence boost from presenting in front of a small and friendly crowd.

# Fake it ‘till you make it.

---

You have rehearsed, you know your content but speaking is still terrifying. That’s ok. We put up a post for how to prepare and pump yourself up for the day closer to our event.

All in all, the experience will go by very quickly and you might even convince yourself that you are a strong, confident, speaker-person.

# Reward yourself for being a badass

---

I have a rewards list. Every time I do something I find hard, I get a little reward of my choosing.

We are all very good at focusing on the negatives, but not so good at rewarding the positives. Acknowledge that you’ve done something that takes confidence!

<br/>

# Remember: we are all there to support you

---

People have come to see you speak about your ideas. They have not come to heckle, but to offer support and learn from you.

<br/>

# Resources

---

I put out a few tweets asking others about resources they have found that help with their confidence. Here are some of the results.

<br/>

## Your body language may shape who you are | Amy Cuddy:
This talks about how your own body language can help yourself feel more confident. _(Suggestion from Rizwana Akmal)_.

#### Video Description:

<p class="quote"><i>Body language affects how others see us, but it may also change how we see ourselves. Social psychologist Amy Cuddy argues that “power posing” — standing in a posture of confidence, even when we don’t feel confident — can boost feelings of confidence, and might have an impact on our chances for success. NOTE: Some of the findings presented in this talk have been referenced in an ongoing debate among social scientists about robustness and reproducibility.</i></p>
